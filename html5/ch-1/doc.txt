How JavaScript interacts with your page
    JavaScript and HTML are two different things. HTML is
    markup and JavaScript is code. So how do you get JavaScript
    to interact with the markup in your page? You use the
    Document Object Model.


    When you load a page into the browser, the browser parses the HTML and creates an internal model of your document, that contains all the elements of your HTML markup.

    Your JavaScript can interact with the DOM to get access to the elements and the content in them. JavaScript can also use the DOM to create or remove elements (among a number of other
    things weâ€™ll be getting to).

    When JavaScript modifies the DOM, the browser updates the page dynamically, so you see new content on your page.
