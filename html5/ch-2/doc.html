    <h2>The Way JavaScript Works</h2>
    <p><b>
            Our goal is to write JavaScript code that runs in the
            browser when your web page is loaded—that code might
            respond to user actions, update or change the page,
            communicate with web services, and in general make
            your page feel more like an application than a document.
            Let’s look at how all that works:
        </b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You create your HTML
            markup and your
            JavaScript code and put
            them in files, say
            index.html and index.js
            (or they both can go in
            the HTML file).
        </li>
        <li>
            The browser retrieves and
            loads your page, parsing
            its contents from top to
            bottom.
            As it encounters JavaScript,
            the browser parses the
            code and checks it for
            correctness, and then
            executes the code.
            The browser also builds an
            internal model of the HTML
            page, called the DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript continues
            executing, using the
            DOM to examine the
            page, change it, receive
            events from it, or ask
            the browser to retrieve
            other data from the
            web server.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Handling events
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set up a handler to handle the user’s click on the “Add Song” button.

        </li>
        <li>

            Write the handler to get the song name the user typed in, and then...

        </li>
        <li>

            Create a new element to hold the new song, and...

        </li>
        <li>

            Add the element to the page’s DOM.
        </li>
    </ul>
