undefined, is a value. Type of undefined is undefined.

typeof:
    typeof operator.
    ex:
        var name = "nanda"
        typeof name, returns String, return type of typeof is string.

null:
    null is typeof Objects

undefined
    undefined is typeof undefined


document.getElementById('head') if the element is not found the method returns null.


NaN - not a number. In some cases javascript unable to generate the number. In that case NaN is assigned

example: var name = 10 * 'nanda'
to check NaN, use isNaN(name)


comparison operatod ==

    1. if the two variables are same type, it compares straight away and returns the result.

    2. If they are different,

        1. comparing number and a string,
            1 == "1"
            string is converted to number and two numbers are compared.
        
        2. comparing boolean with anyother type.
            true/false value converted to number "1"/"0"
            then the value "1"/"0" converted to boolean
            1 == true
            0 == false

        3. undefined == null, always equal
        4. 1 == "", converted like below,
           1 == 0 


strict equality === and non-equality !==
only one rule,
returns true if type and the value are equal.

How JS converts string to number,
uses algo to parse the individual char from string and convert them into number.


How to compare two objects?

    1. we are comparing references, so if the 2 variables refer same object then they will be equal.

String operations:
    var name ="nanda kumar "
    name.trim()
