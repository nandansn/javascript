What is the window object anyway?
    When you’re writing code for the browser, the window
    object is always going to be part of your life. The window
    object represents both the global environment for your
    JavaScript programs and the main window of your
    app, and as such, it contains many core properties and
    methods.


    example window properties
        window
            location
            status
            onload
            document
    example window functions
        alert
        prompt
        open
        close
        setTimeout
        setInterval
        

    Window is the global object. It may seem a little weird, but the window object acts as your global environment, so the names of any properties or methods from window are resolved even
    if you don’t prepend them with window. In addition, any global variables you define are also put into the window namespace, so you can reference them as window.myvariable.

document object:
    The document object is another familar face; it’s the object we’ve been using
    to access the DOM. And, as you’ve just seen, it is actually a property of the
    window object. Of course we haven’t used it like window.document because we
    don’t need to.


    example document object:

        document property:
            domain
            title
            URL
        document functions:
            getElementById
            getElementsByTagName
            getElementsByClassName
            createElement


element object:
    One more object to think about: your element objects
    We shouldn’t forget when we’re working with methods like getElementById that the
    elements they return are also objects! Okay, you might not have realized this, but now that
    you know, you might be starting to think everything in JavaScript is an object, and, well,
    you’re pretty much right.
    You’ve already seen some evidence of element properties, like the innerHTML property;
    let’s look at some of the more notable properties and methods:
