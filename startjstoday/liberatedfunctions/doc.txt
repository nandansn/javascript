function expression:

    example:
        var displayName = function(name) {
            console.log(displayName)
        }


        displayName(nanda)

        displayName  is a function reference or reference to a function.

        function expressions are evaluated later.

        function expression returns reference to a new function created by the expression.


    function declaration:
        example:

        function displayName(name) {
            console.log(name)
        }

        function declaration is not a expression. function declaration is a statement.

        function declarations are evaluated before rest of the code.

        function declaration does not return a reference to a function.

        function declaration does not create reference to a function, rather it creates a variable with the name of the function and assign the new function to it.

        var newDisplay = displayName;
        newDisplay('nanda')


        start thinking about functions as values, just like numbers, strings, booleans or objects.
         The thing that really makes a function value different from these other values is that we can invole it.
