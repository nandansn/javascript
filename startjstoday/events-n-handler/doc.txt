events:
    mouse click
    cursor movement
    key clicks
    ..etc

event handler:
    is a function


example
    1. create a functions that handles page load event when it occurs.
    2. wire up things, so the browser knows, there is a function to be onvoked when load event occurs.


event object:
    how the event object works?
        1. you click an image
        2. click event is triggered
        3. click event creates an event object.
        4. that is then passed to event handler object.
        5. in the event handler function you can use event object to determine the things about the event, like what type of event occurred and which element generated the event.
        6. eventObject.target tells which element generated the event.


events and queues:
    Browser maintains queue of events
    Browser processes these events one at a time.
    Need to keep these handlres short and efficient.

Code laboratory:
we can use the function like an expression.

var sum = function(a,b) {
    var c = a + b;
}

sum(a,b);

image.onclick = function() {
    alert("element clicked")
}


time out:
    setTimeout(eventHandlerFunction, 5000)

    setTimeout method in the window object is called, after 5 seconds of page gets loaded.
